## Motivation

The Pokémon dataset offers a rich and structured environment for
applying data science methods to explore relationships between
attributes, performance, and design balance. Each Pokémon is described
by a variety of quantitative and categorical features—such as type,
stats, generation, and legendary status—making it an excellent case
study for classification, clustering, and predictive modeling. Analyzing
this dataset allows us to practice fundamental data science workflows,
including data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and model
evaluation, while also addressing interesting questions such as: What
characteristics make a Pokémon strong? Are legendary Pokémon
statistically distinct from others? By combining statistical reasoning
with creative curiosity, this project aims to turn a familiar and
entertaining topic into a meaningful data-driven exploration.

## The Intended Final Products

1.  **Interactive Data Dashboard**
    - A flexdashboard or Shiny app that visualizes Pokémon
      characteristics (e.g., type distribution, attack–defense balance,
      or power rankings).
    - Users can filter by generation, type, or legendary status, and
      explore how attributes vary across categories.
2.  **Statistical or Predictive Model**
    - A classification model predicting whether a Pokémon is legendary
      based on its stats and type.
    - A regression model predicting a Pokémon’s overall strength or
      combat performance.
3.  **Clustering & Typology Analysis**
    - Use unsupervised learning (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering,
      PCA) to group Pokémon with similar characteristics.
    - Visually present clusters and interpret the biological or
      strategic meaning of each group.
4.  **Data Storytelling Report and Video**
    - An R Markdown report or GitHub Pages website summarizing insights
      with visuals and narrative.
    - A Youtube Video explaining the Pokemon world views and all related
      features will be presented.
5.  **Comparative Analysis**
    - Compare Pokémon stats across generations or types to explore how
      design balance has evolved.

## Anticipated Data Sources

The data is mainly from Kaggle; the latest data is imported and
extracted manually from the Bukbagarden.

## The Planned Analyses / Visualizations / Coding Challenges

### The Planned Analyses

With this dataset, we wanted to be able to answer the following
questions:

- Is it possible to build a classifier to identify legendary Pokemon?
- How does height and weight of a Pokemon correlate with its various
  base stats?
- Which type is the strongest overall? Which is the weakest?
- Which type is the most likely to be a legendary Pokemon?
- Can you build a Pokemon dream team? A team of 6 Pokemon that inflicts
  the most damage while remaining relatively impervious to any other
  team of 6 Pokemon.

### Visualizations

- Dashboard with interactive plots to explore relationships between
  different attributes (e.g., scatter plots of attack vs. defense, bar
  charts of type distributions).
- Heatmaps to show correlations between different stats.
- Clustering visualizations (e.g., dendrograms, cluster plots) to
  illustrate groupings of similar Pokémon.
- Violin plots or box plots to compare stat distributions across
  different types or generations.

### Coding Challenges

- Data cleaning and preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing
  data, and encoding categorical variables.
- Feature engineering: Creating new features that may improve model
  performance.
