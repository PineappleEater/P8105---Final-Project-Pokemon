# P8105 Final Project Proposal

**Tentative Project Title:** 
The story and mystery of Pokemon

**Group Members:** 
Leah Li(yl5828), Ruipeng Li(rl3616), Xuange Liang (xl3493), Yiwen Zhang (yz4994)

**Motivation:** 
The Pokémon dataset offers a rich and structured environment for applying data science methods to explore relationships between attributes, performance, and design balance. Each Pokémon is described by a variety of quantitative and categorical features—such as type, stats, generation, and legendary status—making it an excellent case study for classification, clustering, and predictive modeling. Analyzing this dataset allows us to practice fundamental data science workflows, including data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and model evaluation, while also addressing interesting questions such as: What characteristics make a Pokémon strong? Are legendary Pokémon statistically distinct from others? By combining statistical reasoning with creative curiosity, this project aims to turn a familiar and entertaining topic into a meaningful data-driven exploration.
** The intended final products:**
1. Interactive Data Dashboard
A flexdashboard or Shiny app that visualizes Pokémon characteristics (e.g., type distribution, attack–defense balance, or power rankings).
Users can filter by generation, type, or legendary status, and explore how attributes vary across categories.
2. Statistical or Predictive Model
A classification model predicting whether a Pokémon is legendary based on its stats and type.
A regression model predicting a Pokémon’s overall strength or combat performance.
3. Clustering & Typology Analysis
Use unsupervised learning (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering, PCA) to group Pokémon with similar characteristics.
Visually present clusters and interpret the biological or strategic meaning of each group.
4. Data Storytelling Report and Video
An R Markdown report or GitHub Pages website summarizing insights with visuals and narrative.
A Youtube Video explaining the Pokemon world views and all related features will be presented. 
5. Comparative Analysis
Compare Pokémon stats across generations or types to explore how design balance has evolved.


**Anticipated data sources: **
The data is mainly from Kaggle; the latest data is imported and extracted manually from the Bukbagarden.

**The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges:**
With this dataset, we wanted to be able to answer the following questions:
Is it possible to build a classifier to identify legendary Pokemon?
How does height and weight of a Pokemon correlate with its various base stats?
Which type is the strongest overall? Which is the weakest?
Which type is the most likely to be a legendary Pokemon?
Can you build a Pokemon dream team? A team of 6 Pokemon that inflicts the most damage while remaining relatively impervious to any other team of 6 Pokemon.
